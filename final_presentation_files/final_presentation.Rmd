## Introduction 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%" ,out.height="70%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/duke_chronicle_article.png")
```

## Questions of Interest

- What factors influence college drinking behavior? 
- Relationship between drinking policies and college drinking behavior
- Relationship between college drinking behavior and sexual assault (caused by drinking)


## Data Cleaning

- Concentrated on 1997 dataset
- Used predictors from original survey questions 
- Zero-imputation for NA answers to ordinal data (if sensible)

## EDA: Drinking Habits


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/reasons_plot.png")
```

## EDA: Drinking Habits

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/num_drink_plot.png")
```


## EDA: Elastic Net 

- $\textbf{Heavy Drinking (+)}$
    - Importance of parties in college experience
    - Disruptive/loud drinking
    - Opinion on off-campus bar (# acceptable drinks)
    - \% friends who are binge drinkers
    - HS binge behavior in senior year

## Dimension Reduction

- Grouping into Latent Factors
- Factors: Correlated and Interpretable
    - for lavaan, latent factors must be continuous
- Ordinal predictors for each factor

## Dimension Reduction
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/latent_vars.png")
```


## Latent Variable Model

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/latent_variable_model.png")
```

## SEM 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/mediation_analysis.png")
```


## Discussion 

- Influential Factors: 
  * High school drinking habits are positively associated with an increase college drinking behavior
  * Worse academic well-being is associated with an increase in college drinking, while better personal wellbeing is associated with a decrease in college drinking
- Policies: 
  * Both school and local policies did not have a significant effect on college drinking behavior
  * Less education material on drinking is associated with less drinking (possibly due to reactionary effect)
  
## Discussion Cont'd and Future Work 
- Sexual Assault: 
  * High school drinking habits alone and through mediator contributes the most to incidences of sexual assault
- We assume linearity and normality in our models, so in the future we want to extend to non-parametric models with SEM
